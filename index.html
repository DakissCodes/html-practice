        <h1>LEARN MORE ABOUT ME...</h1>
        <h2>Hello, I'm Justine!</h2>
        <p>I recently just started my web development journey using The Odin Project.
            It has been a blast so far. I have always been interested in programming, but 
            never had the courage to try it our for myself. After a few hours of scouring 
            the internet for the best self-taught resource, I stumbled upon The Odin Project. I was hooked a few days into learning
            and looking towards pursuing it as a hobby or possible a career.
        </p>
        <h3>Here are some of my goals:</h3>
        <p>1. Learn to make a website after 3 months using html, css and Javascript . </p>
        <p>2. A foundational understanding of databases</p2>
        <p>3. Learn a framework such as DJango or Node</p3>
        <h3>And possibly more...</h3> 
        <p>Wish me luck!</p>
